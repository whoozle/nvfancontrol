nvfancontrol is simple script used for controlling speed of nvidia's fans.

Before we start, please be careful, because incorrect values could damage your
hardware, so use this script at your own risk.

First of all, you need to switch on "CoolBits" in xorg.conf allowing you
access to hidden features of nvidia's drivers. You might turn on the third
bit (4), so if you already had value "1", you need add 4 to it and use "5".
If you don't have "Coolbits", just put the following into "Device" or "Screen" 
section of xorg.conf.

    Option         "Coolbits" "4"

Then restart X11, and launch nvidia-settings. Check that coolbits actually work
for you: you will see fan speed checkbox and slider under "Thermal Settings".

Please check minimal temperature and speed values for your fan using this slider
and adjust MINSPEED=/MINTEMP= values in nvfancontrol file.

You might adjust MAXTEMP/MAXSPEED too, but it's not recommended and could be
dangerous.

I noticed that my driver rolls fan with 27% speed and the temperature stays the
same as for minimal speed (17% for my card).

As you finish the setup, try running ./nvfancontrol. If everything's all right,
quit it with ctrl-c and launch ./nvfancontrold.

You could launch nvfancontrold from any directory without changing current
directory like /home/xxx/nvfancontrol/nvfancontrold or even put it in autorun of
your favourite window manager.

Have fun. :)
